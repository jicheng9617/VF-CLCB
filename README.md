### VF-CLCB
* This is the MATLAB implementation of a variable-fidelity constrained optimization method named VF-CLCB.
* A VF-CLCB criterion is proposed to improve the performance when optimizes computationally expensive constrained optimization problems with multiple levels of fidelity.
* PVF-CLCB is an extended criterion of the VF-CLCB criterion for parallel computing structure.
